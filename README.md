# StackOveflow Time Prediction
A ML based project to predict the answer time for questions asked in Stack Oveflow.

(Dataset used here is a really old one.)

In-progress. Project still in Data Cleaning and EDA phase

The script data_cleaning.py is used to clean the data. It also creates many columns containg binary which represents whether a specific tag is being used in the question or no. A new Top_tags_binary.csv file is created from which unnecessary columns are then manually removed using simple remove tool in Excel
